                      A traditional office is where you check in at 9, check out
                      at 5, and count the days to weekends and vacations. But it
                      doesn’t have to be that way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At Total Environment, we have designed and delivered
                      living spaces for 25 years, by blurring the boundaries
                      between the indoors and outdoors, making living in our
                      homes feel more like a resort vacation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We apply the same philosophy to our workspaces by
                      embracing nature to bridge the gap between work and
                      vacation.

                      located on the ITPL Main Road, close to residential
                      communities, schools, shopping centres, cultural hubs,
                      hospitals, restaurants & hotels. Efficient connectivity
                      and a well-developed social infrastructure have led to
                      this area becoming self-sufficient. Good employment
                      opportunities, coupled with a talent pool of highly
                      skilled manpower, has had a positive impact on the
                      residential and commercial real estate markets in
                      Whitefield, thereby making it a brand that many companies
